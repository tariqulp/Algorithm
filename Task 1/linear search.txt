#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x[]= {23,2,11,5,19,3,7,17,23,29};
    int i,data=5;
    for(i=0; i<10; i++)
    {
        if(data==x[i])printf("%d found at %d",data,i);
    }
}

time complexity:

In best case the time complexity would be O(1)
The worst case would be O(n) because there could be case where we would iterate through the full array but didn't find the data or the data is at the last.
